/**
 * Runs one scroll preset against the elements matching `selector` inside a scoped container.
 *
 * Three properties are guaranteed here rather than left to each call site. Animations are created
 * inside `useGSAP`, so every tween, ScrollTrigger, and pin spacing is reverted on unmount and
 * React Strict Mode's double mount cannot stack them. Selector text is scoped to the returned
 * container ref, so a second instance of a component never animates the first one. And the whole
 * effect lives inside a `gsap.matchMedia` branch keyed to `prefers-reduced-motion`, so the
 * reduced case is not a slower animation — it is the finished state, reached immediately.
 *
 * The elements are rendered visible. This hook is what hides them, from JavaScript, a frame before
 * animating them back. If the script never runs, the content is simply there.
